# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing `handle_error` Method**
**Problem**: The original `SummarizationAgent` and `QualityScoringAgent` didn't inherit from `BaseAgent`, causing `'SummarizationAgent' object has no attribute 'handle_error'` errors.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `workflow.py` to use the refactored agents that inherit from `BaseAgent`
- Changed imports to use:
  ```python
  from agents.summarization_agent_refactored import SummarizationAgent
  from agents.quality_score_agent_refactored import QualityScoringAgent
  ```

### 2. **Broken Retry Logic**
**Problem**: The retry counter was showing endless "attempt 1/2" messages because:
- The logic counted total accumulated errors instead of NEW errors
- It wasn't properly detecting when an agent had already been retried
- This caused infinite retry loops

**Solution**: 
Fixed the `_should_retry` method to:
```python
def _should_retry(self, state: AgentState, agent_name: str, max_retries: int = 2) -> bool:
    # Get current retry count BEFORE incrementing
    current_retries = state.retry_counts.get(agent_name, 0)
    
    # Only consider the LATEST error for this agent
    agent_errors = [e for e in state.errors if e["agent"] == agent_name]
    
    # Check if there's a NEW error (errors list grew since last check)
    has_new_error = len(agent_errors) > current_retries
    
    if has_new_error and current_retries < max_retries:
        state.retry_counts[agent_name] = current_retries + 1
        return True
    
    return False
```

### 3. **Missing Import**
**Problem**: `main.py` was missing `import os` causing NameError when accessing `os.getenv()`.

**Solution**: Added `import os` to `main.py`.

## Verification Tests

Created comprehensive test scripts to verify fixes:

1. **`test_retry_logic.py`** - Tests normal workflow operation
2. **`test_retry_simulation.py`** - Tests retry logic with simulated failures
3. **Updated `test_refactored.py`** - Full integration test

## Test Results

### Before Fix:
```
❌ Infinite retry loops:
Retrying summarization (attempt 1/2) due to errors: ["'SummarizationAgent' object has no attribute 'handle_error'"]
Retrying summarization (attempt 1/2) due to errors: ["'SummarizationAgent' object has no attribute 'handle_error'", "'SummarizationAgent' object has no attribute 'handle_error'"]
... (continues infinitely)
```

### After Fix:
```
✅ Proper retry behavior:
Retrying summarization (attempt 1/2) due to error: First error
Retrying summarization (attempt 2/2) due to error: Second error  
Max retries (2) exceeded for summarization. Final error: Third error
```

### Workflow Success:
```
✅ Workflow completed!
Status: success
Processing time: 9.66s
Summary: ✓ (4 key points)
Quality scores: ✓
```

## Files Modified

1. **`workflow.py`**:
   - Updated agent imports to use refactored versions
   - Fixed retry logic to properly track new errors vs total errors

2. **`main.py`**:
   - Added missing `import os`

3. **Test files created**:
   - `test_retry_logic.py` - Basic workflow testing
   - `test_retry_simulation.py` - Retry logic testing
   - `BUG_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test basic workflow
uv run python test_retry_logic.py

# Test retry logic specifically
uv run python test_retry_simulation.py

# Test main CLI
uv run python main.py data/sample_transcripts/customer_support.txt

# Test full refactored code
uv run python test_refactored.py
```

## Summary

All bugs have been resolved:
- ✅ No more `handle_error` attribute errors
- ✅ Retry logic properly respects max retry limits
- ✅ No more infinite retry loops
- ✅ Main CLI and workflow function correctly
- ✅ All test cases pass

The refactored codebase is now stable and production-ready.
