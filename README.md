# AI Call Center Assistant

A sophisticated multi-agent system for call center analysis with automated transcription, summarization, and quality assessment. Built with LangGraph, OpenAI, and Deepgram APIs.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for transcription, summarization, and quality scoring
- **Speaker Diarization**: Advanced audio processing with speaker identification using Deepgram
- **Quality Assessment**: Structured rubric-based evaluation of tone, professionalism, and resolution
- **Modern UI**: Professional Streamlit interface with real-time progress tracking
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry logic and fallback mechanisms
- **Flexible Input**: Supports both audio files and text transcripts

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- OpenAI API key (required)
- Deepgram API key (required for audio transcription)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd call_summarizer_agents

# Install with uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or install dependencies manually
pip install -e .
```

### Configuration

```bash
# Copy environment template and add your API keys
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI and Deepgram API keys
```

### Usage

#### CLI Interface

```bash
# Process a transcript file
uv run python main.py data/sample_transcripts/customer_support.txt

# Process an audio file
uv run python main.py audio.mp3

# Launch web interface
uv run python main.py --ui

# Show help
uv run python main.py --help
```

#### Web Interface

```bash
# Launch Streamlit UI
uv run streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py
```

The web interface provides:
- File upload for audio (.mp3, .wav, .m4a) and text (.txt) files
- Real-time processing progress
- Interactive results with speaker-segmented transcripts
- Quality score visualizations with gauge charts
- Detailed feedback and analysis

## Architecture

### Agent System
- **Base Agent**: Common functionality and error handling
- **Transcription Agent**: Deepgram + OpenAI Whisper fallback with speaker diarization
- **Summarization Agent**: GPT-4 powered analysis with speaker-aware context
- **Quality Scoring Agent**: Structured rubric evaluation (tone, professionalism, resolution)

### Workflow
- **LangGraph**: Orchestrates agent execution with intelligent routing
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry on failures with configurable limits
- **State Management**: Persistent state across agent interactions
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of partial failures

### Configuration
- **Centralized Settings**: Environment-based configuration management
- **Model Selection**: Configurable LLM providers and models
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and error reporting

For detailed system architecture and project structure, see **[Architecture Documentation](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## Development

This project uses `uv` for dependency management. For detailed development commands, code quality tools, and testing procedures, see **[Development Guide](CLAUDE.md)**.

## API Requirements

- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for LLM operations
- **Deepgram API Key**: Required for audio transcription with speaker diarization

See `.env.template` for configuration details.
